A shell for your shell

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/laluxx/shell
cd shell
sudo make install && ./shell
#+end_src>
* Features
This shell is relatively new, i started developing it at 2024-11-06.
But it already has some nice features to it.
** Electric_pair_mode
Automatically insert matching closing delimiter for '(', '{', '[', '"', "'"
and try to be smart about it.
** Xclip integration
When yanking with C-y it uses the system clipboard
using xclip, so you don't have to use C-V anymore.

Also killing with C-k or C-w copied so the system clipboard (not true TODO)
