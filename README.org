** Features
This shell is relatively new, i started developing it at 2024-11-06.
But it already has some nice features to it.
*** Electric_pair_mode
Automatically insert matching closing delimiter for '(', '{', '[', '"', "'"
and try to be smart about it.
*** Xclip integration
When yanking with C-y it uses the system clipboard
using xclip, so you don't have to use C-V anymore
